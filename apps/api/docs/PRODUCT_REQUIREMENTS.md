# 📋 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> **Project Name:** Atlas Platform  
> **Status:** 🟢 Active / Planning  
> **Document Version:** 1.0.0  
> **Target Release:** v1.0 MVP

## 🎯 1. Product Vision & Overview

**Atlas Platform** is an Enterprise Multi-Tenant Headless CMS designed to handle complex content structures across isolated tenant environments. It aims to bridge the gap between heavy monolithic CMS platforms and lightweight headless solutions by providing built-in asynchronous background processing, advanced caching, and a developer-friendly API-first architecture.

### 🌟 Key Objectives
- **True Multi-Tenancy:** Provide robust data isolation and customizable environments for multiple clients under a single deployment.
- **High Performance:** Guarantee lightning-fast read operations via Redis caching and optimized database queries.
- **Asynchronous Reliability:** Ensure heavy tasks (like ZIP exports or media processing) never block the main thread by utilizing RabbitMQ workers.

## 👥 2. Target Audience

| Persona | Needs | Pain Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enterprise Developers** | API-first design, robust SDKs, clear documentation. | Hard-to-customize legacy CMS platforms. |
| **Content Managers** | Intuitive structure, fast draft-to-publish workflows. | Slow UI, confusing multi-site management. |
| **System Admins** | Easy deployment (Docker/CI-CD), role-based access control. | Security leaks between tenants, hard-to-scale apps. |

## 📦 3. Core Features (MVP Scope)

### 🔐 3.1 Authentication & Security
- **JWT & Refresh Tokens:** Secure API access with short-lived access tokens and rotation.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Granular permissions for admins, editors, and viewers.
- **Tenant Context Isolation:** Every request is strictly scoped to the authenticated tenant.

### 📝 3.2 Headless CMS Engine
- **Dynamic Content Types:** Flexible structures for articles, products, or custom entities.
- **Category & Taxonomy Management:** Hierarchical organization of content.
- **Draft/Publish Workflow:** State management for content before it goes live.
- **Media Management:** Upload, delete, and list media assets securely.

### ⚙️ 3.3 Background Processing
- **RabbitMQ Integration:** Event-driven architecture for heavy lifting.
- **ZIP Export Service:** Generate bulk content exports asynchronously.
- **Real-Time Job Tracking:** Redis-backed progress tracking for long-running tasks.

---

## 🏗️ 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability:** Must support horizontal scaling via Docker and stateless architecture.
- **Performance:** Sub-100ms response time for cached API reads.
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime target for API endpoints.
- **Observability:** Centralized logging and error tracking (prepared for OpenTelemetry/Prometheus).

## 💻 5. Tech Stack Requirements

> *The chosen stack represents a modern, type-safe, and scalable ecosystem.*

* **Backend Framework:** NestJS (Node.js)
* **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
* **Caching Layer:** Redis
* **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ
* **Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose
